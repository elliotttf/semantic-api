<h3>Intent</h3>

<p>This document will describe how to version a REST API in a <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic</a>
manner, providing predictable releases free of breaking changes. Some of the
workflow may not line up with your individual needs, but the overall concepts
should be widely applicable.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>The semantic version pieces that we will be discussing include the major, minor,
and patch versions as well as prerelease tags. For these definitions, consider
the version <code>v1.2.3-alpha.0</code>. All semantic versions in use <em>must</em> have a major,
minor, and patch version and <em>may</em> have a prerelease tag.</p>

<ul><li>Major – <code>1</code> in our example, the left-most numeral. If this number changes it
indicates that the API has introduced breaking changes which <em>may</em> cause
consumers to break without making code changes of their own.</li><li>Minor – <code>2</code> in our example, the second left-most numeral. If this number
changes it indicates that new features have been added to the API. There will
not be breaking changes for consumers but new functionality will be exposed.</li><li>Patch – <code>3</code> in our example, the third left-most numeral. If this number
changes it indicates a bug-fix. There will not be breaking changes for
consumers but behavior may change based on the fix.</li><li><p>Prerelease tag – <code>alpha.0</code> in our example, anything following a <code>-</code> in the
version string. These tags will be used prior
to a version of the API becoming stable. Consumers <em>may</em> request them but <em>must</em>
understand the different kinds of prerelease tags and what they mean:</p><ul><li><p><code>alpha</code> – the most unstable prerelease tags. Changes between alphas <em>may</em>
introduce breaking changes but <em>must not</em> break any previously stable
features.</p><p>For example: renaming a field: <code>newField</code> to <code>newFields</code> between <code>alpha.0</code>
and <code>alpha.1</code> is acceptable, but renaming <code>oldField</code> to <code>oldFields</code> between
<code>1.2.2</code> and <code>1.2.3-alpha.0</code> is not acceptable.</p></li><li><code>beta</code> – a more stable development state. Breaking changes and new features
<em>must not</em> be introduced at this point. Only bug fixes and refinements on
existing features are allowed.</li><li><code>rc</code> – the most stable development state. Breaking changes, new features,
and refinements <em>must not</em> be introduced at this point. Only bug fixes are
allowed.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3>Release workflow</h3>

<p>Development and unstable API releases will happen in <code>dev</code> environments. After
confirmation of a feature set as “stable enough” a stable release candidate
will be promoted to a staging environment. After confirmation of the release
candidate, a stable version will be released to production. Conceptually this
might look like this:</p>

<ul><li>Dev<ul><li><code>v1.0.0-alpha.1</code> - needs more changes so...</li><li><code>v1.0.0-alpha.2</code> - confirmed stable enough to move forward</li></ul></li><li>Stage<ul><li><code>v1.0.0-rc.1</code> - needs more changes so…</li><li><code>v1.0.0-rc.2</code> - confirmed stable enough to move forward</li></ul></li><li>Prod<ul><li><code>v1.0.0</code> - locked version of previously most stable rc, i.e. <code>v1.0.0-rc.2</code></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>If a <code>beta</code> or <code>rc</code> release is created the previously defined rules about feature
and fix inclusion <em>must</em> be adhered to, or the <code>beta</code> or <code>rc</code> in question <em>must</em>
be abandoned and officially unsupported.</p>

<p>For example: <code>v1.2.3-alpha.5</code> introduces a new feature that is confirmed to be
stable enough to move forward so <code>v1.2.3-beta.0</code> is cut. Later, it is decided
a breaking change to the new feature in <code>v1.2.3-alpha.5</code> needs to be introduced
in <code>v1.2.3</code>. At this point <code>v1.2.3-beta.0</code> <em>must</em> be removed and <code>v1.2.3-alpha.6</code>
added.</p>

<h3>Consumer request workflow</h3>

<p>Consumers <em>should</em> interact with the API using <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning">npm style</a>
semver ranges. This gives maximum flexibility to API consumers, allowing them
to “play it safe” and lock to a given version of the API, or provide a semver
range which will allow subsequent versions to be received without modifying the
consumer code.</p>

<p>Consumers <em>must not</em> lock to a prerelease tag, e.g. <code>v1.2.3-rc.0</code>. The requests
will be rejected as additional changes could be introduced before the API becomes
stable.</p>

<p>Consumers <em>may</em> request a prerelease tag with a range, e.g. <code>^v1.2.3-rc.0</code>. This
will resolve in the way described by npm, but has some important features that
are worth mentioning here:</p>

<p>Range requests against prerelease tags will receive the next prerelease or the
next stable version that satisfies the range.</p>

<p>For example: a request for <code>^v1.2.3-alpha.1</code> will receive the following versions
when/if they are available:
<em> <code>v1.2.3-alpha.2</code>
</em> <code>v1.2.3-beta.0</code>
<em> <code>v1.2.3-rc.0</code>
</em> <code>v1.2.3</code>
<em> <code>v1.2.4</code>
</em> <code>v1.3.0</code></p>

<p>The same request would not receive <code>v1.3.0-alpha.0</code>, or any prereleases for that
matter, on versions outside of the major, minor, and patch versions defined by
the original prerelease range.</p>

<p>Consumers <em>may</em> lock to a stable version or request a range from a stable version,
e.g. <code>v1.2.3</code> and <code>^v1.2.3</code>. While <code>v1.2.3</code> is the latest stable version in the
<code>v1</code> family, these two requests will resolve the same way. As soon as a new minor
or patch version is added the request for <code>^v1.2.3</code> would receive the new version.</p>

<h3>Server considerations</h3>

<p>Implementing servers <em>should</em> provide a <code>meta</code> style attribute to all responses
that describes the version that the request resolved to. In JSON API with a
request for <code>/^v1.0.0/authors</code> and a highest stable version of <code>v1.2.3</code> this
would look like this:</p>

<p><code>
{
  “data”: [],
  “meta” : {
    “version”: “v1.2.3”
  }
}
</code></p>

<p>Implementing servers <em>should</em> enforce strict semantic version matching and
reject any request for an invalid version. This approach is preferable over
attempting to route invalid or partial versions (e.g. <code>v1.2</code>) to the correct
and valid version.</p></div>
